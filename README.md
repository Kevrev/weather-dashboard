# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard utilizes a third-party API to provide current and upcoming weather conditions for the next 5 days for any city provided in the search bar. The user is presented with weather conditions like temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon illustrating the current weather conditions at a glance. The search history is saved to local storage and displayed for the user to see.

## Usage

Users are greeted with a search bar from which they can enter a city of their choice. The respective weather conditions for the current time and upcoming 5 day forecast are retrieved through the OpenWeather API and displayed on the page. To search for a new city, users can simply repeat the process. Their search history is saved to local storage and can be cleared with a button at the bottom of the list.
